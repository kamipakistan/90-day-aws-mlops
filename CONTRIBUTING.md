We welcome and appreciate all contributions to this project! Your help is vital in creating a comprehensive and up-to-date roadmap for becoming a production-ready LLMOps Engineer.

Here are the guidelines for contributing:

## How to Contribute

There are several ways you can contribute, ranging from simple suggestions to major content additions:

1.  **Suggest New Resources:** Link great articles, tutorials, courses, or tools relevant to specific phases of the roadmap.
2.  **Propose Improvements:** Fix typos, clarify confusing sections, or improve the structure of existing documentation.
3.  **Add New Sections/Phases:** Propose adding entirely new topics that you feel are missing from the current scope (e.g., specific compliance standards, new frameworks).
4.  **Submit Hands-On Projects:** Propose project ideas or starter code relevant to a specific learning phase.

By contributing, you agree to abide by the following rules:

*   **Keep it Relevant:** Ensure your contributions align with the goal of the roadmap (Beginner → Advanced LLMOps).
*   **Markdown Formatting:** All documentation is written in GitHub-flavored Markdown. Please use appropriate formatting (headings, lists, code blocks).
*   **Adherence to Structure:** Please follow the existing file structure and naming conventions when adding or updating files (e.g., `PHASE_X_TOPIC.md`).

## Contribution Workflow (Git Process)

We use the standard GitHub Pull Request (PR) workflow:

### Step 1: Fork the Repository

First, fork the main repository to your personal GitHub account.

### Step 2: Clone Your Fork

Clone your newly forked repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kamipakistan/120-Day-LLMOps.git
cd 120-Day-LLMOps
```

### Step 3: Create a New Branch
Always work on a new branch, not the `main` branch, to keep your changes isolated:
bash
```
git checkout -b feature/descriptive-branch-name
```

### Step 4: Make Your Changes
Implement your changes, add new files, or update existing ones.

### Step 5: Commit Your Changes
Stage and commit your changes with a clear and descriptive commit message:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "docs: Add new resources for Phase 1 foundations"
```

### Step 6: Push to Your Fork
Push the new branch up to your personal GitHub fork:
```bash
git push origin feature/descriptive-branch-name
```

### Step 7: Open a Pull Request (PR)
Navigate to the original repository on GitHub. You should see a prompt to create a "Pull Request" from your pushed branch.
- **Title:** Provide a clear title for your PR (e.g., "Add Pytorch resources to Phase 2").
- **Description:** Briefly explain the changes you made and why they are valuable to the project. Link to any relevant issues if applicable.

### Review Process
A repository maintainer will review your pull request as soon as possible. They may ask for changes or clarifications. Once approved, your changes will be merged into the `main` branch.
Thank you for contributing to the community!
